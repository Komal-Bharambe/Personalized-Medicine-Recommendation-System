📌 Project Overview

This Medicine Recommendation System uses symptom-based inputs to predict possible diseases and provide personalized health recommendations. It uses multiple machine learning models, 
evaluates their performance, and suggests the best model for disease prediction. Additionally, the system provides useful recommendations like medications, precautions, workouts, and diet plans.
🛠 Tech Stack

    Machine Learning Models:
        SVM (Support Vector Machine)
        RandomForestClassifier
        GradientBoostingClassifier
        KNeighborsClassifier
        MultinomialNB
    Flask (for web-based interaction)
    CSV Files (for dataset storage)
    Python (for model development, training, evaluation, and deployment)

🔍 How It Works

1 User enters symptoms through the interface and clicks the "Recommend" button.
2 The system uses a trained ensemble of classifiers to predict the disease based on the input symptoms.
3  Multiple models (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and MultinomialNB) are compared using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
4 The best-performing model is then saved using Pickle for future use. The model is later loaded 

using:

pickle.load(open("model/svc", "rb"))

5 After prediction, the system presents the following options to the user:

    Disease Name
    Description
    Precautions
    Medications
    Workouts
    Diet Plans
    6 The user can click on each option for detailed recommendations, creating a virtual doctor-like experience.

📌 Project Overview

It uses multiple machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and suggests the best model for disease prediction. Additionally, the system provides useful recommendations like medications, precautions, workouts, and diet plans.

    Flask (for web-based interaction)
    CSV Files (for dataset storage)
    Python (for model development, training, evaluation, and deployment)

🔍 How It Works

1️⃣ User enters symptoms through the interface and clicks the "Recommend" button.
2️⃣ The system uses a trained ensemble of classifiers to predict the disease based on the input symptoms.
3️⃣ Multiple models (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and MultinomialNB) are compared using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
4️⃣ If the upper and lower diagonals of the confusion matrix are 0, the model is considered perfect for predictions.
5️⃣ The best-performing model is then saved using Pickle for future use. The model is later loaded using:

pickle.load(open("model/svc", "rb"))

6️⃣ After prediction, the system presents the following options to the user:

    Disease Name
    Description
    Precautions
    Medications
    Workouts
    Diet Plans
    7️⃣ The user can click on each option for detailed recommendations, creating a virtual doctor-like experience.

📊 Dataset & Data Loading

    The following CSV datasets are used to train the model and provide recommendations:
        symptoms.csv
        precaution.csv
        workout.csv
        description.csv
        medication.csv
        diets.csv
    Each dataset contains information relevant to the disease prediction and health recommendations.
    A dictionary with 132 lists is created, where each list contains corresponding data items for the disease classification.

🚀 Features

✔️ Multiple model comparison to determine the best-performing model.
✔️ Disease prediction based on user symptoms.
✔️ Provides disease descriptions, medications, precautions, workouts, and diet plans.
✔️ Pickle-based model saving and loading for efficient deployment.
✔️ Uses Flask to provide an interactive web interface.
✔️ Data stored and retrieved from CSV files instead of a database for simplicity.

🎯 Conclusion

The Medicine Recommendation System provides a personalized virtual doctor experience, predicting diseases and offering medication, 
precautions, workouts, and diet plans based on user symptoms. The system dynamically evaluates multiple models, 
selects the best-performing one, and delivers accurate health recommendations.
